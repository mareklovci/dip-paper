\chapter{Quality Classification System}\label{ch:quality-classification-system}

The original idea was to leverage some Machine Learning classification algorithm to automatically classify datasets.
During thesis elaboration the referential materials turned out to be insufficient in providing usefull information on the topic, hence different technique was chosen (composite statistical score-card evaluation).
Shortcoming of white-papers about Machine Learning supported DQ classification probably results from the absence of well-defined general DQA algorithm and output classes.
Complexity of developing all-embracing method for DQA competes with unfolding general artificial intelligence, indeed.

Resulting system should be similar to machine learning ensemble methods (ensemble voting).
