\chapter{Case Study}\label{ch:case-study}

In December 2019, a virus known as COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China~\cite{seznam-korona2021}.
Three months later, on March 1, 2020, the first three cases of the disease were confirmed in the Czech Republic~\cite{seznam-korona2021}.
The disease has shown and continues to show the shortcomings of social and political environment worldwide.
But the disease, although very serious, has given us many opportunities.
One such opportunity is open datasets made available by state institutions.

In the following part of the work we will try to analyze the state of datasets provided by the institutions of the Czech Republic.
We apply the metrics defined in Chapter 3 to the data in order to objectively measure their quality and comment on the results.
Available datasets as of April 1, 2020 from the URL address \url{https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/} are listed in Appendix~\ref{ch:dataset-collection}.

\section{Technical Analysis}

The data can be downloaded via the REST API in JSON, in addition, the data can be downloaded in CSV together with metadata also in JSON format.
The format of the JSON data file can be seen in Figure~\ref{ls:data}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "modified": "2021-04-18T12:28:42+02:00",
    "source": "https:\/\/onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz\/",
    "data": [
        {
            ...

    ]
}
    \end{lstlisting}

    \caption{Data file structure}
    \label{ls:data}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

All data files contain one main object, with three keys (modified, source and data).
The \enquote{modified} key contains the date and time of the dataset update in ISO 8601 format, offset from UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
The \enquote{source} key contains the dataset's URL, especially the protocol and domain name.
The last key, \enquote{data}, contains an array of json objects with a structure specified by the metadata.
This is an array of objects even if the array contains only one object.
Figure~\ref{ls:sample-data-deceased} depicts a sample structure of the objects in the list.

An example of the structure of the metadata file can be found in the appendix~\ref{ch:metadata-file-structure}.

\section{Data Quality Criteria Analysis}

Long et al. (2004) wrote a comprehesive data quality checklist for emergency medical services data~\cite{long2004}.
We will use this checklist as a base for our own data evaluation.

\subsubsection{Form Design and Completion}

\begin{QandA}
    \item The data retrieval form was designed by a team that includes methodologists, a form design expert, representatives for those who are responsible for completing the form, as well as other subject matter experts.
    \begin{answered}
        Data are issued by IHIS CR.
        The criterion is \textbf{met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item The purpose and population of interest are clear and well documented.
    \begin{answered}
        The purpose of the data is clear.
        The population to be monitored is precisely defined, individuals infected with COVID-19 and individuals tested or vaccinated.
    \end{answered}

    \item There is adequate justification for each field gathered.
    \begin{answered}
        The accessible data is preprocessed and therefore each field in the dataset has a purpose.
        The purpose may not be obvious at first glance, but all fields are defined and annotated in the metadata. 
        We consider this criterion to be \textbf{met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item The form is user-friendly and is accompanied by a clear, readily accessible, and user-friendly manual that describes in detail the data collection guidelines including when and how to complete the form and defines each field in detail.
    \begin{answered}
        Data is available through a well-defined API.
        Although instructions for data collection are either missing or very difficult to find.
        As this absolutely essential requirement is violated, we consider the criterion to be \textbf{not met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Those responsible for completing the form receive training so that they are able to properly complete the form.
    \begin{answered}
        Unknown.
    \end{answered}

    \item As part of training, the importance of the data is conveyed and those responsible for completing the form are tested and immediate feedback is provided regarding the reliability and validity of their performance.
    \begin{answered}
        Unknown.
    \end{answered}

    \item Those responsible for completing the form are allocated the time and have the motivation to do so, as well as confidence in the form completion process.
    \begin{answered}
        Unknown.
    \end{answered}

    \item The data are monitored for outliers, logical errors, completeness, and consistency and ongoing monitoring and constructive feedback is provided to the primary collectors where necessary.
    \begin{answered}
        Data monitoring information is unknown. But the data contains logical errors.
        Feedback to primary collectors (hospitals, medical facilities and sanitation stations) is very difficult to implement.
        We consider the criterion to be \textbf{not met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Any major revisions to the original form design (purpose, structure, etc.) of the database and the dates of any major revisions are known, documented, and readily available. Moreover, an explicit consideration of overall trade-offs between accuracy, cost, timeliness, and respondent burden was conducted at the design stage.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on the design phase is unknown.
        To our knowledge, changes to the API design are not available to the public, if documented at all.
        For this reason, we consider the criterion to be \textbf{not met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item A revised form is pilot tested until high standards of reliability and validity are met and the pilot test results are readily available.
    \begin{answered}
        Unknown.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\paragraph{Logical Errors} One of the most serious errors in the data catalog is the absence of categorization of deaths.
% V datasetu, obsahujícím data o úmrtí pacientů, se dozvíme datum úmrtí, věk pacienta, pohlaví a kódy kraje a obce ze kterého pacient pocházel.
In the dataset, which contains data on patients' deaths, we learn the date of death, the patient's age, gender and the codes of the region and municipality from which the patient came.
It does not take into account whether the patient was very ill (e.g., a patient with a stage 4 pancreatic cancer with primary tumor and metastasis outside pancreas) and therefore had a high probability of death, or if the patient was a completely healthy person.
No consideration of this fact leads to the introduction of virtually immeasurable systematic (logical) error.

A similar issue can be observed in the data on new COVID-19 cases and the daily number of tests performed.
In the first case we are unable to determine whether there are any percentage of patients in whom the disease manifested itself repeatedly.
In the second case, information on retested patients is missing, as well as information on whether the tested patient showed symptoms of the disease.
All these problems lead to a reduction in data quality, which we are not able to measure effectively.

\subsubsection{Frame}

By the "frame" we mean the structure of files containing data.
The COVID-19 API is well documented and easy to understand.
During the epidemic, the API was shown to be continuously updated.

\begin{QandA}
    \item The frame is known and documented.
    \begin{answered}
        The criterion is \textbf{met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item The frame is maintained in an ongoing manner.
    \begin{answered}
        The criterion is \textbf{met}.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\subsubsection{Over Coverage}

Over-coverage is caused by the existence of objects not belonging to the frame, as well as units that appear in the target population multiple times~\cite{over-coverage}.

\begin{QandA}
    \item Only qualifying data suppliers are on the frame.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on data suppliers is not available.
        The criterion is \textbf{unknown}.
    \end{answered}

    \item The data are checked for duplicates and erroneous entries from qualifying suppliers.
    \begin{answered}
        Unknown.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\subsubsection{Under Coverage}

Over-coverage is caused by exclussion of objects belonging to the frame~\cite{under-coverage}.

\begin{QandA}
    \item Data are received from all qualifying data suppliers on the frame.
    \begin{answered}
        Unknown.
    \end{answered}

    \item The list of those actually sending data are compared to independent lists.
    \begin{answered}
        Given the nature of the data, the existence of third party lists can be questioned.
        We therefore consider the criterion not to be met.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\subsubsection{Response}

\begin{QandA}
    \item The overall expected and actually received number of records are known and tracked per year and response across month is checked and compared against previous years.
    \begin{answered}
        This criterion is in principle difficult to meet.
        The number of records is not known in advance and, due to the relatively short existence of the dataset, it was not possible until recently to compare the data with previous time periods.
        We consider the criterion to be \textbf{not met}, although the question remains whether it is valid for our case.
    \end{answered}

    \item The amount of missing data per record is known and tracked per field per year and key fields (e.g., age, gender, and clinical code) are at least 98\% complete.
    \begin{answered}
        Key data has been remeasured, the criterion is \textbf{met}.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\subsubsection{Completeness}

\begin{QandA}
    \item The patient service form/chart used for data retrieval from abstraction is easy to understand.
    \begin{answered}
        There is no information available on internal procedures.
    \end{answered}

    \item The form/chart used for abstraction is complete.
    \begin{answered}
        There is no information available on internal procedures.
    \end{answered}

    \item All patient encounters/visits are abstracted and represented in the database.
    \begin{answered}
        There is no information available on internal procedures.
    \end{answered}

    \item All fields are systematically completed per patient record.
    \begin{answered}
        There is no information available on internal procedures.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\subsubsection{Bias}

\begin{QandA}
    \item Explicit standard guidelines are in place and adherence is monitored for data collection.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Clear guidelines and training eliminate as much as possible the need for interpretation.
    \begin{answered}
        The IHIS CR does not provide data training for external candidates and we do not have information available about the training of internal employees.
        The data are quite clear, but due to their sensitivity it is appropriate to interpret them.
        For this reason, we consider the criterion to be \textbf{not met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item For data that need to be classified, clear coding standards are available.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

    \item For data that need to be classified, the available standards are adhered to.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

    \item For data that need to be classified, only highly trained certified staff classify the data.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Sources of bias (e.g., upcoding) are understood and eliminated if possible and ongoing quality assurance tests ensure that data collection, abstraction, and entry are conducted in a standard manner according to guidelines.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\subsubsection{Validity}

\begin{QandA}
    \item The patient service form/chart is complete and reflects the patient encounter and the codesheet or abstract that is based on the form/chart reflects what is in the form/chart.
    \begin{answered}
        Since we do not work with complete input data, this question is irrelevant.
        However, we have a dataset with patient data (age, gender, residence) that directly corresponds to the input data.
        For this reason, we consider the requirement to be \textbf{met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Adequate resources are in place to ensure valid timely data and ongoing database improvement.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Random audits and/or reabstraction studies are conducted and the data are compared to external sources of the same or similar data (if possible).
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Validity coefficients are available and are greater than or equal to 0.8 for key data elements (i.e., postal code, patient age, most responsible diagnosis, procedures, and comorbities).
    \begin{answered}
        The IHIS CR itself does not provide any validity metrics.
        This requirement is \textbf{not met}.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\subsubsection{Reliability}

The level of agreement between repeated administrations of a diagnostic test by evaluators~\cite{kilem2008}.

\begin{QandA}
    \item Reliability studies of key data elements (e.g., age, gender, and clinical code) are conducted at regular intervals.
    \begin{answered}
        Information on internal procedures is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Intra rater coefficients are available.
    \begin{answered}
        The IHIS CR itself does not provide any reliability metrics.
        This requirement is \textbf{not met}.
    \end{answered}

    \item Evaluation coefficients for key data elements are greater than or equal to 0.8. (i.e., postal code, patient age, most responsible diagnosis, procedures, and comorbities).
    \begin{answered}
        Intra-rater coefficients are not available.
        The criterion is \textbf{not known}.
    \end{answered}

\end{QandA}

\section{Data Quality Evaluation}

Table~\ref{table:dimensions-score} provides an evaluation of the dimensions.
All dimensions will be of the same weight, because we are not able to objectively assess the importance of individual dimensions.
By averaging the results, we obtain the value \( 2.\overline{3} \), which belongs to the score \enquote{marginal (2)}.

The second highest rating was given to the data catalog.
The data can thus be improved in many ways, but the end result corresponds to our perception of the catalog's qualitative condition.

\section{Application of the Methodology}

Returning to the methodology discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:methodology}, we will implement the framework to our use case.
The entire specification process was solved by utilizing the completed questionnaire from Long et al. (2004).
The \textbf{identification} activity was completed by analyzing the state of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) data in the Canadian health care system.
A questionnaire, which is part of this work, is used to \textbf{specify metrics}.
Metrics were \textbf{verified} using EMS administrative data~\cite{long2004}.
We don't know if the \textit{specification process} was iterative (in the feedback loop), but it's safe to assume it was.
We would introduce feedback into the process by verifying metrics ourselves.
However, we believe that metric verification is beyond the scope of this paper because it would necessitate interdisciplinary collaboration with health data experts.

The data \textbf{collection} activity, which is part of the \textit{execution process}, is completely covered by IHIS CR data.
The main part of this chapter is data \textbf{verification}, in which the data catalog is evaluated in terms of data quality.
The analysis result should be attached to the data, and the catalog should be marked as verified or rejected as part of the \textbf{contract} activity.

\section{Summary}

The possibilities of statistical analysis of the selected dataset are limited and determining their quality is very difficult.
The main reason for the difficulties is the nature of the data, which corresponds in structure to econometric data – already processed in a certain way – but without the freedom to use the usual statistical methods.
Thus, an available data catalog is in practice a set of results without background data.
Moreover, we tried to draw conclusions from existing data and tried to learn their quality without knowledge of the criterial limitations and general description of the data, which should be determined by the methodological guideline.
However, the instructions providing the necessary information about the data is missing (or is insufficiently informative) in these cases.

Nevertheless, we assessed the 89 questions posed in the article by Long et al. (2004).
Through the evaluation, we drew attention to possible problems with the data and their interpretation.
Despite all efforts to be objective, the data are very extensive and it is therefore possible that part of the questionnaire was not properly evaluated due to insufficient analytical coverage.

% Another factor reducing the quality is the methodology itself.
% According to the methodology, a person is considered cured since the last negative test.
% However, it does not take into account whether this person is still in the \textit{Intensive Care Unit} with post-COVID syndrome or whether he is really cured.
