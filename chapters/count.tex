There are several forms of data consistency.

The \textbf{first form} is actual wide or narrow distribution of data.
In this way, consistency of data can be viewed as stability, uniformity or constancy.
Typical measures include statistics such as the range (i.e., the largest value minus the smallest value among a distribution of data), the variance (i.e., the sum of the squared deviations of each value in a distribution from the mean value in a distribution divided by the number of values in a distribution) and the standard deviation (i.e., the square root of the variance).
If one is evaluating the consistency of data drawn in a sample from a population, the standard error of the mean (i.e., the standard deviation of the sampled population divided by the square root of the sample size) is often examined.
Finally, the constancy of data produced by instruments and tests is typically measured by estimating the reliability of obtained scores.
Reliability estimates include test-retest coefficients, split-half measures and Kuder-Richardson Formula \textnumero 20 indexes.

Then, there is \textbf{second form} of data consistency; whether data are uniformly defined throughout the dataset, that is, across variables and over time.
For example, suppose we want to use the data to estimate real estate sales per year to see how that number has changed over time.
In this case, we have to make sure the estimates of real estate sales are uniformly defined over time.
Specifically, does the data series always either include apartments or exclude apartments from the counts?
Does it always either include houses or exclude houses from the counts?
If the data sometimes include apartments, but not always, or if the data sometimes include houses, but not always, then the data are inconsistent.

Inconsistencies in data can be due to changes over time and/or across variables for example, in
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item vintages or time periods,
    \item units,
    \item levels of accuracy,
    \item levels of completeness,
    \item inclusions and exclusions.
\end{enumerate*}
Those inconsistencies occur most often when merging or aggregating datasets, therefore the user has to make sure data are consistently defined throughout.
