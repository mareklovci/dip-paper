Due to the diversity and complexity of these techniques, research has recently focused on defining methodologies that help the selection, customization, and application of data quality assessment and improvement techniques. The goal of this article is to provide a systematic and comparative description of such methodologies. Methodologies are compared along several dimensions, including the methodological phases and steps, the strategies and techniques, the data quality dimensions, the types of data, and, finally, the types of information systems addressed by each methodology. The article concludes with a summary description of each methodology.},

  abstract  = {The twenty-first century has seen a breathtaking expansion of statistical methodology, both in scope and in influence. 'Big data', 'data science', and 'machine learning' have become familiar terms in the news, as statistical methods are brought to bear upon the enormous data sets of modern science and commerce. How did we get here? And where are we going? This book takes us on an exhilarating journey through the revolution in data analysis following the introduction of electronic computation in the 1950s. Beginning with classical inferential theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference. The book ends with speculation on the future direction of statistics and data science.}

  abstract  = {The fundamental algorithms in data mining and analysis form the basis for the emerging field of data science, which includes automated methods to analyze patterns and models for all kinds of data, with applications ranging from scientific discovery to business intelligence and analytics. This textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate data mining courses provides a broad yet in-depth overview of data mining, integrating related concepts from machine learning and statistics. The main parts of the book include exploratory data analysis, pattern mining, clustering, and classification. The book lays the basic foundations of these tasks, and also covers cutting-edge topics such as kernel methods, high-dimensional data analysis, and complex graphs and networks. With its comprehensive coverage, algorithmic perspective, and wealth of examples, this book offers solid guidance in data mining for students, researchers, and practitioners alike. Key features: Covers both core methods and cutting-edge research Algorithmic approach with open-source implementations Minimal prerequisites: all key mathematical concepts are presented, as is the intuition behind the formulas Short, self-contained chapters with class-tested examples and exercises allow for flexibility in designing a course and for easy reference Supplementary website with lecture slides, videos, project ideas, and more}
