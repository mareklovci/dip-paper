All an attacker needs is 500 unique malware files to achieve 99+ percent certainty that at least one of those files will make it into the victim’s.

Machine learning’s best fit is to be part of a comprehensive solution.

Algorithms without similar “training” – fall into the category of unsupervised machine learning – are almost useless for cybersecurity. While able to sort data into new categories, they don’t necessarily distinguish between clean items and malware. This makes them suited to finding similarities or anomalies in the dataset invisible to the human eye, but it doesn’t make them better at separating the good from the bad.
