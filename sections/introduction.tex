\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

In our highly disruptive society over 1 trillion MB of data is generated daily. \url{https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#gref}
All industries are generating data and are in need of using those data to analyze, manage and control various systems.

\section{Ideas}

\subsection{Data Quality Rules}

There are a number of general data quality rules one can deduce from a Feedback-Control Systems view of information systems~\cite{10.1145/269012.269023}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unused data cannot remain correct for very long;
    \item data quality in an information system is a function of its use, not its collection;
    \item data quality will, ultimately, be no better than its most stringent use;
    \item data quality problems tend to become worse as the system ages;
    \item the less likely some data attribute (element) is to change, the more traumatic it will be when if finally does change;
    \item laws of data quality apply qually to data and metadata.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In principle, we can classify three types of system stability:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stable System (Absolute and Conditional stability);
    \item Marginally Stable System;
    \item Unstable System.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analytics Types}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Descriptive – what happened in the past;
    \item Diagnostic – why something happened in the past;
    \item Predictive – what is most likely to happen in the future;
    \item Prescriptive – recommends actions to affect those outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Differential Privacy}

\subsection{Quality Classification}

The original idea was to leverage some Machine Learning classification algorithm to automatically classify datasets.
During thesis elaboration the referential materials turned out to be insufficient in providing usefull information on the topic, hence different technique was chosen (composite statistical score-card evaluation).
Shortcoming of white-papers about Machine Learning supported DQ classification probably results from the absence of well-defined general DQA algorithm and output classes.
Complexity of developing all-embracing method for DQA competes with unfolding general artificial intelligence, indeed.

Resulting system should be similar to machine learning ensemble methods (ensemble voting).

%Artificial intelligence is one of the most promising technologies of our times~\cite{ai_citizens}.

%In the chapter~\ref{ch:machine-learning-and-cybersecurity}, I will discuss the ML model security risks and convolution of machine learning, cybersecurity and enterpise solutions.
%Chapter~\ref{ch:malicious-url-detection-and-classification} is going to present available datasets and on page~\pageref{sec:text-feature-extraction} will be demonstrated approach for malicious URL detection.
%The third chapter on page~\pageref{ch:model-analysis} introduces the model explanation framework.
%As a~practical example of use of machine learning for cybersecurity with ability to justify its claims, I am going to make an application in Python programming language using machine learning library \textit{scikit-learn} and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) framework for explaining classification of URL addresses.
